# Architecture
* Connect ios project is implemented using the <strong>Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)</strong> architecture pattern.
* Model represents the data and business logic of the application
* View represents the user interface (UI) of your application
* ViewModel acts as a mediator between the Model and the View. It communicates with the Model to fetch data and update it as needed.
It also listens to user interactions from the View and acts accordingly, updating the Model if required.
